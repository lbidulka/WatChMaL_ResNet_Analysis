# WatChMaL_ResNet_Analysis
Results plotting for the forthcoming WatChMaL ResNet particle identification paper.


## Notebooks:
### watchmal_paper_4class_plotting.ipynb
- Contains plots for all 3 tasks of the 4-class model: e vs gamma, e vs muon, and e vs pi0. For each task there are ROC curves as well as binned true_momentum, dwall, towall, zenith and azimuth plots.
### watchmal_paper_e_gamma_plotting.ipynb
- Contains plots for the 1 task of the 2-class model: e vs gamma. For this task, the 2-class and 4-class results are plotted together on ROC curves as well as binned true_momentum, dwall, towall, zenith and azimuth plots.

## Results Folders:
### 4_class_results
- Contains 3 sub-folders, one for each task e vs gamma, e vs muon, and e vs pi0. Within each task sub-folder, there are jpgs for each plot produced by watchmal_paper_4class_plotting.ipynb.
### e_gamma_combined_results
- Contains jpgs for each plot produced by watchmal_paper_e_gamma_plotting.ipynb for the e vs gamma task.
